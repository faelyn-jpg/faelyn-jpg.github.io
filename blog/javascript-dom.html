    <h1>Technical Blog - JS Fundamentals</h1>
    <h2 class="heading-style">JavaScript, HTML and CSS</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">JavaScript, HTML and CSS are all separate components of building a website that come
      together to make a functioning web page. HTML is a text markup language that helps give meaning and structure to
      the content of a web page, CSS is the styling on top of the structure of HTML, and Javascript is the interactivity
      of the web page. If a web page was a house, HTML would be the interior structure, the CSS is all the paint and
      decorations, and JavaScript is all the appliances. </div>
    <h2 class="heading-style">Explain Control Flow and Loops</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">Control flow is the order that JavaScript goes through and runs your code, which
      includes stopping at a loop if there is any, checking if conditions are met to continue, or running a function. If
      I were to take on the task of chopping up wood to start the fire, the control flow would be going through all the
      tasks in order to get enough kindling, including getting the wood, chopping the wood up and taking it all to the
      fireplace. As per control flow, I would stop at the “loop” of chopping up the kindling, as I need to take a piece
      of wood, chop it up, and check if I have enough kindling. If I don&#39t have enough yet, I will repeat the process
      until I do. Then, as per control flow, I would continue on the rest of the task of bringing all the chopped wood
      inside to the fireplace.</div>
    <h2 class="heading-style">What is the DOM?</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">The DOM (Document Object Model) is a logical model that follows a treelike structure to
      affect web pages. The tree represents objects on a web page that surrounds the structure and behavior of a
      document, and the objects that comprise the web page. It is specifically for managing HTML (and XML) documents, to
      manipulate the syntax of CSS. The DOM is the representation of the HTML that is shown to users who visit the web
      page.
    </div>
    <h2 class="heading-style">How do you interact with the DOM?</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">To access HTML elements with Javascript within the DOM structure, you can select
      elements by ID, tag name, class name, find them with CSS selectors, or find them by HTML object collections. To
      access your HTML with Javascript via the DOM, the DOM starts out at the document and works its way inward with a
      tree structure, parsing over different objects to find what it wants to interact with. You can use JavaScript to
      select elements using the above element selectors, which then you could modify in lots of different ways,
      including changing its attributes, styles, content, or position on the web page. You could also create new
      elements or delete existing ones. Another thing you can do is listen for an event, like a mouse click or movement
      of the mouse, or even a keypress, among other things. </div>
    <h2 class="heading-style">What is the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects?</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">
      <p>
        Objects are best used to represent something specific in your code, something that is made up of multiple
        characteristics, like a person or an animal, or even a car. The characteristics of these objects are properties
        called a “key” and a “value”, which can be any kind of data, like numbers, booleans, strings, another object, or
        arrays. <img src="../images/object-example.png" />You can access this data inside of an object directly with dot
        notation, like in the example below.
        <img src="../images/object-dot-notation-example.png" />
      </p>
      <p>
        An array is useful for storing a list of similar items in a single variable. Arrays can store the same kind of
        data as objects can, including another array or an object. <img src="../images/array-example.png" />
        An array is best when you want an ordered collection of items in which you can access the information using
        their numerical position, or their “index”.
        <img src="../images/array-index-example.png" />
      </p>
      <p>
        With either an array or an object, you could use a loop to iterate through the data.
        <img src="../images/object-loop-example.png" />
        <img src="../images/object-loop-result.png" />
        <img src="../images/array-loop-example.png" />
        <img src="../images/array-loop-result.png" />
