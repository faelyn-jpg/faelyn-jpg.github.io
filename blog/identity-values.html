    Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you
    weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and
    how you reflect on the decision now. <br />
    I was moving out of my flat where I was allowed pets into a flat that did
    not, and I owned two rats, one of which was getting quite elderly (Rats only
    live about 3 years and almost always end up dealing with repository
    infections). I had to decide whether or not to see if someone I knew would
    be willing to adopt an elderly rat and his cagemate, or put him down
    prematurely and give away the younger one by himself. I ended up asking a
    friend, who I knew already owned rats, if they would be willing to take them
    even though one was quite old. Thankfully they agreed to take them, and I'm
    really thankful as he ended up living another 6 months or so. <br />
    Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
    values and identity. <br />
    As a queer person, I found it important to meet other queer people at a
    young age, and the activities I enjoyed happened to have a lot of other
    LGBTQ+ people interested in them too. The people around me valued kindness,
    acceptance, and perspective. I've been ingaged in various different creative
    hobbies, and many creatives encorage sharing of information and helping
    others. My closest friends have encoraged philosophcial discussions, and
    trying to see things from as many different perspectives as possible. <br />
    Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
    journey. <br />
    I am friendly and a team player, I'm not particularly selfish and try my
    best to help as many people as possible with my knowledge, and try to see
    things from others point of view. This will support me in a collabritive
    enviroment, as I value everyone's opinions greatly and try to take them all
    into account when making decisions, but I also value my own creativity and
    don't let other peoples opinions cloud my own perspective. <br />
    Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development.
    How might these affect your learning journey? <br />
    I am not particularly assertive when it comes to talking in enviroments
    where I don't know as many people, and often find myself talked over if I
    can't figure out a way to speak my mind. I've had multiple interacts where I
    had an answer to a problem, but could only offer my suggestion after other
    people had tried. This can be a strength in some circumstances, but not
    great for productivity. <br />
    Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
    but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
    time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies
    you would try now and why. <br />
    I was working in an ice cream shop at the time when my boss asked me and
    another co-worker to try making one of the more extravagantly designed
    Christmas themed ice cream cakes. It was fairly difficult to get the cream
    to stick to the ice cream cones that were placed upside down to make
    Christmas trees, and they were getting fairly frustrated with it. I ended up
    coming up with a solution that worked but less resembled the picture we were
    working off of, and they thought that it would look to dissimilar. I ended
    up giving it a shot anyway, as their strategy wasn't working, and they were
    right that it didn't look quite like the design. We ended up suggesting that
    the design was a bit too complicated for the abilities we had at the time,
    so our boss decided to not sell any Christmas themed ice cream cakes that
    year.
