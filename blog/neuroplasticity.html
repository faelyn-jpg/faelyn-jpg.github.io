    <h1>Neuroplasticity and Mindset</h1>
    <h2 class="heading-style">
      Discuss your understanding of Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset and how it influences your learning
    </h2>
    <div class="blog-container">
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset are similar topics that share a common concept in your ability to harness
        trial and error to help your brain develop in new ways. Neuroplasticity is your brain's capability for growth
        over time, eventually reorganizing how your brain reacts in different scenarios or learning something new.
        Growth mindset is about your personal capability to use your neuroplasticity through dedication and hard work to
        achieve outcomes, and about your ability to learn through resilience and error. Having a positive outlook on
        failure, seeing it as a positive thing to help you learn, and finding the nuggets of information you get out of
        something not working the way you expected is part of having a growth mindset.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because learning a programming language is difficult, and learning the concepts around finding new ways to look
        at problems can be very challenging, having a positive outlook on your attempts at a problem is a great way to
        keep persevering through challenges. I think personally, having a growth mindset will help me stay curious
        without getting overwhelmed about looking like an idiot when Iâ€™m experiencing trouble with figuring something
        out.
