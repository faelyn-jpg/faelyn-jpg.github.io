    <h2 class="heading-style">What is Emotinal Intelligence?</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">Emotional Intelligence or EQ is the ability to manage and understand your own emotions,
      and the emotions of the people around you. Emotional Intelligence is usually associated with empathy, but also
      related to self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, and social skills.
    </div>
    <h2 class="heading-style">How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">EQ is about your emotional abilities, social skills and other emotional qualities, how
      you relate to yourself and others. IQ is about your intelligence, problem solving skills, your cognitive and
      academic abilities. They both measure your ability to think, but EQ is more about personable skills whereas IQ is
      about raw intellect.
    </div>
    <h2 class="heading-style">Why is EQ important?</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">Having a good sense of your EQ is important because it allows you to manage
      interpersonal relationships better, have an intrinsic sense of calmness and clarity, and you can work with others
      in a more productive manner. If you can empathize with others and communicate effectively, you will be an
      invaluable asset to your team that helps everyone in a concise manner. Feeling heard and valued in a workplace
      leads to more productivity. Specifically, in a workplace environment where everyone is collaborating on a web
      project, being able to listen to feedback from an unbiased perspective and understanding others people's wants or
      needs will help the whole project go smoothly.
