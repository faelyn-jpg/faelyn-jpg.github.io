    <h2 class="heading-style">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human
      Skills learning?
    </h2>
    <div class="blog-container">
      The three things I have learned about myself during this time doing Human Skills learning are that I am prone to
      getting caught in the trap of doing something well and feeling like I’m doing better than I am, so when I am
      challenged I feel particularly bad about the fact that I don’t understand.
      <br>
      I also learned that I can both be easily distracted by other interesting things but also get really into what I’m
      doing which causes me to forget to take breaks, which could cause me to get more fatigued. I need to learn how to
      balance these traits.
      <br>
      I continue to avoid asking for help until I really can’t figure my way around a solution, which leads me to waste
      more time on tasks that could actually be very easy, but this is also a positive as I find I do more learning when
      I am being challenged, I tend to learn less when I’m in my comfort zone.

    </div>
    <h2 class="heading-style">What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
    </h2>
    <div class="blog-container">
      Empathy plays a big role in learning to program, as having empathy for yourself aids in learning in a more
      balanced way and gives you space to actually think through problems without blaming yourself. It also plays well
      in working with others, as being able to hold space for other people's feelings can help you communicate more
      effectively. Self-awareness also helps in these regards, as being able to understand when you’re being too
      critical of yourself or others is beneficial for lessening the negative feelings you face when you’re unable to
      work around a coding problem.
    </div>
    <h2 class="heading-style">What has surprised you the most about Human Skills learning? </h2>
    <div class="blog-container">
      What has surprised me the most about Human Skills learning is about how important it is for learning programming.
      At first I didn’t realize how important being able to have solid skills in emotional balance and empathy would be
      for a technical field, but it makes more sense now that I realize how often in technical fields you will be
      challenged and also that you’ll be working with other people.
    </div>
    <h2 class="heading-style">What were the most challenging aspects of Human Skills learning?</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">
      I guess trying to talk about myself is one of the more challenging aspects of Human Skills, it’s a little
      vulnerable to open yourself up like that to others and try to be as realistic as possible with your abilities
      whilst learning a new concept.
    </div>
    <h2 class="heading-style">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human
      Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">
      As a programming school that dedicates a good amount of effort in making people both better programmers and also
      job ready graduates, having a solid understanding in various Human Skills is beneficial in giving you the right
      mindset for a career in which you will never stop learning. Being open to being wrong, having a balanced view of
      yourself and your ego, and being ready to take on new ideas are great for becoming a better programmer. It also is
      good for working with others, as the skills you learn to be balanced with your own self will aid you in having a
      balanced view of others and being able to work together effectively.
    </div>
    <h2 class="heading-style">Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time?
      Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">
      I felt like some of it could’ve been better spent learning the material a bit more thoroughly, especially since
      this course is aimed at people with no prior knowledge of programming, so I felt as though some of the time of my
      day was spent writing things that only has some tangential effect on my programming skills, though as this course
      is aimed at a wide group of different people with different life experience, having some time spend thinking about
      your Human Skills could be more beneficial for some people over others. Overall, I think the time we’ve spent on
      learning about Human Skills will aid us in our transition over to the Bootcamp style of learning, as we will be
      challenged more and being able to stay level headed will be a useful skills for keeping morale up for ourselves
      and others.
