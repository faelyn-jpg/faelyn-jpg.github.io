    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2 class="heading-style underlined"><a href="te-whare-tapa-wha.html">Te Whare Tapa Whā</a></h2>
    <h2 class="heading-style">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">
      My long term goal is still to gain confidence in Web Development as a basis, but more broadly for other areas of
      development as also just as a way to grow as an individual. I am less worried about specific careers right now,
      I’m just looking for character development and for the learning I do in the bootcamp to guide me on what I like
      and don’t like about Web Development so I can have a more solid sense of what I would like to do afterwards.
    </div>
    <h2 class="heading-style">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">
      My biggest strength in Bootcamp will be my drive to accomplish what I set out to do, I generally don’t give up on
      things I decide are important for me. Sometimes deciding what is important and what is not is a struggle for me,
      but once I decide I am very dedicated. I have fairly high expectations of myself, but I also strive to be
      realistic with what I spend my time on.
      <br>
      One of my biggest limitations will likely be trying to figure out how to get enough sleep to start the day out on
      the best foot possible. I tend to struggle to get to bed when I spend my days productively, as I want more time to
      relax and I think I’ll be pretty tight on time. I’ll be looking to get as much sleep as is realistic for me, but I
      expect this to be an issue while I get my sleep hygiene in order.
    </div>
    <h2 class="heading-style">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">
      I expect to struggle with speaking in front of groups. I tend to be quiet and attentive when in larger groups and
      I think I’ll find it difficult to find my turn in conversations even if I think I have good ideas. I also expect
      to lose a little bit of steam half way through the bootcamp as the weeks start to feel less novel and more
      repetitive(in terms of my day to day routine).
    </div>
    <h2 class="heading-style">What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while
      at Dev Academy?</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">
      I’m hoping to gain some self confidence, especially when working in groups, as I tend to be fairly shy/reserved
      when working with groups of people. I tend to lack confidence in my own ideas being worthwhile to a team, even if
      I personally think they might be good ideas, I struggle with the possibility that my ideas will not be received
      well, even though cognitively I know that having good and bad ideas is part of the process. I tend to just go
      along with what other people want to do, even if I have some reservations.
    </div>
    <h2 class="heading-style">What are your expectations for the Bootcamp team?</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">
      My expectations are that I’ll be able to be supported in a relatively timely manner (I understand that the
      facilitators are also helping others), that the information we receive will be relatively concise, with room for
      exploration for ourselves. I can seek help from both online facilitators and those in person. I can also seek some
      help from other students- though I expect we will all be focused on our own learning as a priority.
    </div>
    <h2 class="heading-style">My commitment for managing workload</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">
      I am planning in advance for a lot of my time to be taken up by learning. I have planned to be at the course on
      time, tuned into all of the lectures and commitments to be places when and where I say I will. I’ve scheduled out
      flexible time blocks for when I’m supposed to be learning, and once I get settled into a rhythm I can iron out
      when I need to be learning and time committed to relaxing/spending time with those I care about. Sticking to
      promises is important to me, especially so I don’t waste other people's time when we will all be pressed for it.
    </div>
    <h1>Sprint 2 Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2 class="heading-style">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">My goal with being at Dev Academy is to gain confidence in Web Development as a basis
      for learning other kinds of development, I'm interested in test development and cybersecurity as options,
      but I want to get a solid footing in Web Development before deciding.</div>

    <h2 class="heading-style">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning </h2>
    <div class="blog-container">I've been using computers all my life so I'm quite familiar with troubleshooting, I tend
      to be
      very focused when I'm interested in something or have a decent understanding to jump off of. I have
      some limitations learning brand new skills when I'm very confused, I don't understand where I should
      start from and am resist to just pick a place to go from. The less interested I am in a particular
      area the more trouble I have at starting.</div>

    <h2 class="heading-style">What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while
      at Dev Academy? <br>
    </h2>
    <div class="blog-container">I hope to develop skills in perserverance through hardship, the ability to step outside
      of my worldview
      to look at problems from many different angles</div>.

    <h2 class="heading-style">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should
      include:<br>
    </h2>
    <h2 class="heading-style">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other
      learners,
      Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">I've been working on sticking to new commitments over the past three months in
      preparation for Dev Academy,
      like starting a new exercise regiment and sticking to it, and practicing learning Web Development
      every weekday. I will aim to continue this trajectory, and expand my ability to stick to all of my
      commitments. </div>

    <h2 class="heading-style">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you </h2>
    <div class="blog-container">First and foremost, taking short breaks to give myself time to think about my problems
      from new angles. Longer breaks when I really need to give myself a break. Prioritizing
      exercise and sleep in a way that works with my commitments.</div>

    <h2 class="heading-style">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way </h2>
    <div class="blog-container">I have friends who have done web development or are currently in the field that I can
      ask for help,
      but obviously they are not always avaliable when I need help, so I will also make sure to ask
      my facilitators and other members in my cohort for advice.</div>

    <h2 class="heading-style">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
    <div class="blog-container">I expect a supportive learning enviroment where the facilitators can help me when I need
      it, and help guide me towards figuring out answers for myself instead of just telling me the answer.
      I expect support in guiding me out of the tunnel vision that I'm bound to get when I'm facing
      a problem with my code.</div>

    <h2 class="heading-style">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
    </h2>
    <div class="blog-container">For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to
      plan these in.
      I only have a few commitments inside course hours, I have a dentist appointment mid September
      and also have to take a friend to a dentist appointment. I do plan to exercise every weekday,
      ideally in the morning before 8:30am so I have the mental energy to keep on task all day, but have
      planned to do it after 5:30pm in the event that I can't do it in the morning. I'm going to a concert
      on 14th of November in Auckland with Harry, we've planned so we leave on a Wednesday afternoon and
      are going to be studying during the day on the Thursday and Friday, and coming back on the Saturday.
      The concert was planned before we realised we were studying, so when I was doing the booking I
      planned around the fact that we would need to be studying while we're in Auckland. </div>
