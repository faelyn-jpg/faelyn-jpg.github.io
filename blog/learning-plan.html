      What is your long term goal or career pathway? <br>
      My goal with being at Dev Academy is to gain confidence in Web Development as a basis
      for learning other kinds of development, I'm interested in test development and cybersecurity as options, 
      but I want to get a solid footing in Web Development before deciding. <br> 
      
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning <br>
      I've been using computers all my life so I'm quite familiar with troubleshooting, I tend to be
      very focused when I'm interested in something or have a decent understanding to jump off of. I have
      some limitations learning brand new skills when I'm very confused, I don't understand where I should
      start from and am resist to just pick a place to go from. The less interested I am in a particular
      area the more trouble I have at starting. <br> 
      
      What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? <br>
      I hope to develop skills in perserverance through hardship, the ability to step outside of my worldview 
      to look at problems from many different angles. <br>
      
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:<br> 
      
      An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, 
      Facilitators and industry/community representatives<br>
      I've been working on sticking to new commitments over the past three months in preparation for Dev Academy,
      like starting a new exercise regiment and sticking to it, and practicing learning Web Development
      every weekday. I will aim to continue this trajectory, and expand my ability to stick to all of my
      commitments. <br>
      
      What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you </br>
      First and foremost, taking short breaks to give myself time to think about my problems
      from new angles. Longer breaks when I really need to give myself a break. Prioritizing 
      exercise and sleep in a way that works with my commitments. <br>
      
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way <br>
      I have friends who have done web development or are currently in the field that I can ask for help,
      but obviously they are not always avaliable when I need help, so I will also make sure to ask
      my facilitators and other members in my cohort for advice. <br>
      
      A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team <br>
      I expect a supportive learning enviroment where the facilitators can help me when I need
      it, and help guide me towards figuring out answers for myself instead of just telling me the answer.
      I expect support in guiding me out of the tunnel vision that I'm bound to get when I'm facing 
      a problem with my code. <br>
      
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. <br>
      For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      I only have a few commitments inside course hours, I have a dentist appointment mid September
      and also have to take a friend to a dentist appointment. I do plan to exercise every weekday, 
      ideally in the morning before 8:30am so I have the mental energy to keep on task all day, but have
      planned to do it after 5:30pm in the event that I can't do it in the morning. I'm going to a concert
      on 14th of November in Auckland with Harry, we've planned so we leave on a Wednesday afternoon and 
      are going to be studying during the day on the Thursday and Friday, and coming back on the Saturday. 
      The concert was planned before we realised we were studying, so when I was doing the booking I 
      planned around the fact that we would need to be studying while we're in Auckland.
