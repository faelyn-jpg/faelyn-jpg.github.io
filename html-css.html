    <h2>
      CSS Class vs ID Selectors: What's the best practice for using Class vs ID
      selectors?
    </h2>
    Both Class and ID selectors are used to select an element on your web page
    for styling, applying CSS to the element to make it look how you would like
    it to. But which one should you use? <br />
    ID Selector for Unique Elements. <br />
    ID selectors should only have a single instance on an element on your web
    page. This is probably the most important rule for IDs in CSS, using an ID
    for an element tells us that it is a single instance on your page. For
    example, you could use an ID to target your 'footer' element, as generally
    you would only have one of these on a page. <br />
    <pre class="code-example">
  <span class="code-tag"><<span class="code-name">div </span><span class="code-attr">id</span>=<span class="code-string">"footer"</span>>
  </span>
</pre>
    Class Selector for Repeated Elements. <br />
    Class selectors are used for selecting almost every other element on a web
    page. You can have multiple different class selectors on an element or
    number of elements, you might want to style multiple of the same type of
    element at once, and class selectors are the appropriate selector for this
    use. <br />
    ID selector specificity. <br />
    ID selectors are almost the most specific kind of selector in CSS. If an
    element contains an ID selector, the CSS rules applied to the particular ID
    selector should get applied to the element over other conflicting rules
    applied by class selectors. This can be helpful for intentionally overriding
    other rules being applied to the element you're targetting. <br />
    ID Selectors for Responsive Websites. <br />
    The use of specificity in a website can be very important in a number of
    different scenarios, including responsiveness to your website. Single use
    selectors can be used for internal links, for example, if you wanted to
    create a button that lets you go back to the top of your website. This can
    add a level of responsivness to your website to make the user experience
    easier.
