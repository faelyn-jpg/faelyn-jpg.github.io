        CSS Class vs ID Selectors: What's the best practice for using Class vs
        ID selectors?
      </h2>
      <div class="blog-container">
        Both Class and ID selectors are used to select an element on your web
        page for styling, applying CSS to the element to make it look how you
        would like it to. But which one should you use?
      </div>
      <h2 class="heading-style">ID Selector for Unique Elements.</h2>
      <div class="blog-container">
        ID selectors should only have a single instance on an element on your
        web page. This is probably the most important rule for IDs in CSS, using
        an ID for an element tells us that it is a single instance on your page.
        For example, you could use an ID to target your 'footer' element, as
        generally you would only have one of these on a page.
      </div>
      <pre class="code-example">
  <span class="code-tag"><<span class="code-name">div </span><span class="code-attr">id</span>=<span class="code-string">"footer"</span>></span>
</pre>
      <h2 class="heading-style">Class Selector for Repeated Elements.</h2>
      <div class="blog-container">
        Class selectors are used for selecting almost every other element on a
        web page. You can have multiple different class selectors on an element
        or number of elements, you might want to style multiple of the same type
        of element at once, and class selectors are the appropriate selector for
        this use.
      </div>
      <h2 class="heading-style">ID selector specificity.</h2>
      <div class="blog-container">
        ID selectors are almost the most specific kind of selector in CSS. If an
        element contains an ID selector, the CSS rules applied to the particular
        ID selector should get applied to the element over other conflicting
        rules applied by class selectors. This can be helpful for intentionally
        overriding other rules being applied to the element you're targetting.
      </div>
      <h2 class="heading-style">ID Selectors for Responsive Websites.</h2>
      <div class="blog-container">
        The use of specificity in a website can be very important in a number of
        different scenarios, including responsiveness to your website. Single
        use selectors can be used for internal links, for example, if you wanted
        to create a button that lets you go back to the top of your website.
        This can add a level of responsivness to your website to make the user
        experience easier.
